<h1 style="text-align: center">Data Analysis Results</h1>

Because food is and always will be an important part of people's lifestyle, we analysed restaurants in Bandung area. The data is provided by [pergikuliner](https://pergikuliner.com/) website. Curious? Let's continue reading!

The data that was acquired from the website are the following:

1. The **name** of the restaurant
2. The **region** of the restaurant's location
3. The **type of cuisines** served by the restaurant
4. The **flavor rating** of overall cuisines served
5. The **overall rating** of the restaurant
6. The **price range** of the cuisines for one person

These are the connections in data that we found interesting to visualise and analyse.

- Overall rating average and the restaurant's region
- Flavor rating and the restaurant's region
- Number of restaurants based on its price range
- Number of restaurants based on the type of cuisines it serves
- Number of restaurants based on its location

From **1500 restaurants** which were analysed, this is what we found.

## Overall Rating vs Location

This analysis is to find out which region have the highest overall rating average. There are **83 regions** that were analysed. We analyse five specific regions: Dago Atas, Dago Bawah, Pasir Kaliki, Riau, and Dipatiukur. The other regions are accumulated under 'Other' region.

This is the result of each regions compared to their overall rating average, sorted from the highest to the lowest. The rating is on a scale of 5.

| No. | Region       | Overall Rating Average |
| --- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| 1   | Dago Atas    | 4.0                    |
| 2   | Others       | 3.998                  |
| 3   | Dago Bawah   | 3.954                  |
| 4   | Pasir Kaliki | 3.952                  |
| 5   | Riau         | 3.951                  |
| 6   | Dipatiukur   | 3.807                  |

## Flavor Rating vs Location

Connected to the previous section, we analysed the regions compared to their flavor rating average. The rating's scale is still 5.

| No. | Region       | Flavor Rating Average |
| --- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| 1   | Dago Atas    | 4.347                 |
| 2   | Pasir Kaliki | 4.257                 |
| 3   | Others       | 4.214                 |
| 4   | Riau         | 4.108                 |
| 5   | Dago Bawah   | 4.089                 |
| 6   | Dipatiukur   | 3.915                 |

It turns out that the difference is quite distinctive. Although Dago Atas and Dipatitukur stays at their rank, the other four does not. Pasir Kaliki and Riau region scores higher in ther flavor rating average. On the other hand, Dago Bawah and *Others* region scores lower. Seems like there are a lot of factors deciding the overall rating besides the food, maybe things like cleanliness, service, and the location of the restaurant.
